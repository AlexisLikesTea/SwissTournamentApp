This is an Android app made with Kotlin that allows users to setup 6 player tournaments using the Swiss tournament format.

The point system is as follows
- Win = 1 Point
- Loss = 0 Points
- Draw = 0.5 Points

I made this app for the game nights I host with my friends and I and thus it currently only supports 6 players. I plan to make the amount of players dynamic in the future.
